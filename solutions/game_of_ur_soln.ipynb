    "In the Royal Game of Ur, players advance tokens along a track with 14 spaces.  To determine how many spaces to advance, a player rolls 4 dice with 4 sides.  Two corners on each die are marked; the other two are not.  The total number of marked corners -- which is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 -- is the number of spaces to advance.\n",
