*Think Bayes* is an introduction to Bayesian statistics using computational methods.  

This is the repository for the forthcoming second edition; it is a work in progress.  If you are reading the first edition of the book, you don't want the code in this repo, yet.  Instead, you should go to [the repo for the first edition](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes).

The premise of this book, and the other books in the *Think X* series, is that if you know how to program, you can use that skill to learn other topics.

Most books on Bayesian statistics use mathematical notation and present ideas in terms of mathematical concepts like calculus. This book uses Python code instead of math, and discrete approximations instead of continuous mathematics. As a result, what would be an integral in a math book becomes a summation, and most operations on probability distributions are simple loops.

I think this presentation is easier to understand, at least for people with programming skills. It is also more general, because when we make modeling decisions, we can choose the most appropriate model without worrying too much about whether the model lends itself to conventional analysis. Also, it provides a smooth development path from simple examples to real-world problems.

Note: The code is a version ahead of the book. I have not started revising the book yet.
