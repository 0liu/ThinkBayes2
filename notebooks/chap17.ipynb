    "This chapter introduces Bayesian regression, which is based on the same model as least squares regression; the difference is that it produces a posterior distribution for the parameters rather than point estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example, we looked at changes in snowfall in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, and concluded that we get more snowfall now than when I was young, contrary to my expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We computed the likelihoods two ways: the first is conceptually simple but slow; the second is optimized to use NumPy more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second example, we looked at the progression of world record pace for the men's marathon, computed the joint posterior distribution of the regression parameters, and used it to generate predictions for the next 20 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples have three parameters, so it takes a little longer to compute the likelihood of the data.\n",
    "With more than three parameters, it becomes impractical to use grid algorithms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few chapters, we'll explore other algorithms that reduce the amount of computation we need to do a Bayesian update, which makes it possible to use models with more parameters.\n",
